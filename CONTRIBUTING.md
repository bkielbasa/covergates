# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing **covergates**.
Before you start, please read this document.
It will help you set yourself up with a good development environment.

## Signing the CLA

First, please read and sign the
[Electronic Covergates Contribution License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/covergates/covergates).
By signing a contributor license agreement, it is ensured that the community is free to use your contribution.

## Discuss your Design

Please let everyone knows what you are working on by [creating a issue](https://github.com/covergates/covergates/issues).
This process prevents duplication of effort, and ensure that the idea is discussed and fits the project goal.

## Build and Run

To get starting, it assumes a certain level of comfort with `Go`,
`Vue`, `typescript` and `Docker`. To get some helps, you could refer to below links:

1. [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
2. [What is Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
3. [TypeScript in 5 mins](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
4. [docker for beginners](https://docker-curriculum.com/)

The project also uses [google/wire](https://github.com/google/wire) for dependency injection.
You may refer to [Wire Tutorial](https://github.com/google/wire/blob/master/_tutorial/README.md) for more detail.

### Getting the Source Code

Fork the repository so that you can make a pull request. Then clone your fork by:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<<<your-github-account>>>/covergates.git
cd covergates
```

Create a new branch for your change.
Manage any merge conflicts, commit them, and then push them to your fork.
It is suggested to have one feature or bug-fix per branch.

### Setup SCM (source control management)

**Covergates** requires to connect with SCM to work.
Although you could connect it with GiHub,
it is suggested setting a self-hosted SCM for testing.
It's recommended to choose [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/). You can refer to
[Installation with Docker](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-with-docker/) for the detail.
You can also setup Gitea by running our container for testing:

```sh
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 blueworrybear/gitea-docker
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see if it works.  The admin user and password is `gitea` and `gitea`.

### Run

To test your changes, run:

```sh
# If using blueworrybear/gitea-docker container
export GATES_GITEA_CLIENT_ID="c8c6a2cc-f948-475c-8663-f420c8fc15ab"
export GATES_GITEA_CLIENT_SECRET="J8YYirhYOZY9a9RepaoORN-8EFcSO-sbwjSGvGo4NwE="
export GATES_GITEA_SERVER="http://localhost:3000"
export GATES_GITEA_SKIP_VERITY="true"
go run ./cmd/server
```

Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for the `covergates` server.

### Debug

If yor are using `VS code` as your IDE, you could setup the `launch.json` as blow and press `F5` to debug:

```yml
{
 "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Launch",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "launch",
      "mode": "auto",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/cmd/server",
      "env": {
        "DEBUG": "true",
        "DEBUG_LOGIN": "gitea",
        "DEBUG_EMAIL": "gitea@gmail.com",
        "DEBUG_AVATAR": "http://localhost:3000/user/avatar/gitea/-1",
        "DEBUG_GITEA_TOKEN": "1749a6106454f05f689051c331680c13d78d81b7",
        "DEBUG_GITEA_LOGIN": "gitea",
        "GATES_GITEA_CLIENT_ID": "c8c6a2cc-f948-475c-8663-f420c8fc15ab",
        "GATES_GITEA_CLIENT_SECRET": "J8YYirhYOZY9a9RepaoORN-8EFcSO-sbwjSGvGo4NwE=",
        "GATES_GITEA_SERVER": "http://localhost:3000",
        "GATES_GITEA_SKIP_VERITY": "true"
      },
      "buildFlags": "-tags='debug'"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Working with Frontend

If you would like to change frontend, you may need to change backend server to run on different port by:

```sh
export DEBUG="true"
export DEBUG_LOGIN="gitea"
export DEBUG_EMAIL="gitea@gmail.com"
export DEBUG_AVATAR="http://localhost:3000/user/avatar/gitea/-1"
export DEBUG_GITEA_TOKEN="1749a6106454f05f689051c331680c13d78d81b7"
export DEBUG_GITEA_LOGIN="gitea"
export GATES_GITEA_CLIENT_ID="c8c6a2cc-f948-475c-8663-f420c8fc15ab"
export GATES_GITEA_CLIENT_SECRET="J8YYirhYOZY9a9RepaoORN-8EFcSO-sbwjSGvGo4NwE="
export GATES_GITEA_SERVER="http://localhost:5900"
export GATES_GITEA_SKIP_VERITY="true"
go run ./cmd/server
```

> The **DEBUG** environment variables is required to keep you login to covergates.


And then run:

```sh
cd web
npm install
npm run server
```

It will start a server at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
You could also modify backend proxy by editing `VUE_APP_PROXY` at `web/.env.development`.

### Testing

To test backend, simply run:

```sh
go test ./...
```

or testing with Gitea:

```
go test -tags="gitea" ./...
```

To test frontend, run:

```
cd web
npm run test:unit
```

### Build

To build backend, run:

```sh
go build -o covergates-server ./cmd/server
```

To build CLI, run:

```sh
go build -o covergates ./cmd/cli
```

To build frontend, you require installing `togo` by running below command outside go module folder:

```sh
go get github.com/bradrydzewski/togo
```

And then run:

```sh
go generate ./web
```

## Convention

### Linting is Critical

Please make sure your code pass both `golint` and `eslint` by run:

```sh
golint ./...
cd web
npm run lint
```
