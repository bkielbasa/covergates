## Purpose

Managing coverage reports for private repositories should not be hard!
**Covergates** is to make the easiest way to setup a self-hosted coverage report service.
Use it to improve coding review and quality management flow for your internal projects.
Want to try? Visit [covergates.com](https://covergates.com) before you starting.

## Using

To start service, download [covergates-server.**os**.zip](https://github.com/covergates/covergates/releases), and try:

```sh
unzip covergates-server.<os>.zip
./covergates-server
```

To upload report, download [covergates.**os**.zip](https://github.com/covergates/covergates/releases). Unzip and place it to `/path/to/bin`. Use it for example:

```sh
covergates upload -report <report id> -type go coverage.out
```

## Development

The build is split into `backend`, `cli` and `frontend`. To build backend, run:

```sh
go build -o covergates-server ./cmd/server
```

To build CLI, run:

```sh
go build -o covergates ./cmd/cli
```

To build frontend, it requires:

1. [Node.js v12](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. [togo](https://github.com/bradrydzewski/togo)

Read [web/README.md](https://github.com/covergates/covergates/blob/master/web/README.md) for more details.

## Contributing

It would be highly appreciated if you could contribute to the project.
There are many ways in which you can participate in the project:

1. Contributing directly to the code base

    The expected workflow is [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
    Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/covergates/covergates/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before getting start.

2. [Submit feature requests and bugs](https://github.com/covergates/covergates/issues)

    Especially for the new language support.
    **Covergates** supports `go` and `perl`.
    It would be great if you could provide coverage report examples for other languages.

3. Testing, both unit testing and e2e testing are welcome.
